<p><strong><a href="http://www.pandora-outlet.org">pandora jewelry outlet</a></strong> So any claustrophobia resulting from the throng of &#8220;Pickers&#8221; fans hoping to meet Fritz on Saturday in Daytona Beach was mild by comparison.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.pandora-outlet.org">pandora jewelry outlet</a></strong> Fritz, the &#8220;bearded charmer&#8221; of the History channel's most expensive and wildly popular reality show, is getting used to charming these crowds.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.pandora-outlet.org">pandora jewelry sale</a></strong> &#8220;The show's not about me and Mike,&#8221; he said Saturday in a question-and-answer session in a packed Ocean Center exhibit hall. (&#8220;Mike&#8221; is Mike Wolfe, Fritz's fellow picker, co-star and executive producer since the show first aired in 2010). &#8220;It's about everyone else. There's a little bit of picker in all of us.&#8221;</p><p>Fritz was at the Ocean Center for the 53rd annual Home Show presented by The Daytona Beach News-Journal, which continues from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday in the beachside convention center. Despite his rise to fame, he joked that if reality television had made him rich, he &#8220;wouldn't be doing home shows on my day off.&#8221;</p><p>In fact, Fritz's transition from fire and safety inspector to full-time collector to reality star has in some ways made the picking slimmer. When he negotiates a price, he's carrying the weight of the show behind him. Some sellers look to cash in on what they see as deep pockets. Fritz said the show doesn't finance his or Wolfe's purchases.</p><p>A woman in the crowd asked Fritz if he was a millionaire by now, citing the rumored $65,000-per-episode salary of Austin &#8220;Chumlee&#8221; Russell, a co-star of History's similarly popular reality show &#8220;Pawn Stars.&#8221; Fritz insisted he's not getting rich. For every $100 he makes, he said, &#8220;$15 goes to my agent, $5 goes to my lawyer and $40 goes to Obama.&#8221;</p><p>News-Journal political editor Derek Catron led the Q-and-A and asked a series of his own questions, including how Fritz maintains his &#8220;charmer&#8221; persona despite working 15-hour days alongside Wolfe and crew, much of the time spent traveling around the country.</p><p>Fritz joked that the cameras don't always capture the frustrations. </p><p>&#8220;I've got 14 people right in my grill every single second of the day unless I'm going to the bathroom,&#8221; he said of the crew. The show's recent picking excursion to Italy &#8220;wasn't a great big vacation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was a lot of work.&#8221;</p><p>Fans of the show know Fritz's diplomatic reputation was sealed when Fritz rescued Wolfe during a pick on a farm. The owner had released his guard dogs on Wolfe, who was cornered against a wall. </p><p>&#8220;I was like, 'Listen, man, just take the dogs away, and I'll get the hell out of here,'&#8221; Wolfe said on-camera in 2010. &#8220;And he's like, 'No. You're not going anywhere.' ... That's when I started calling (Fritz) the bearded charmer, because he started charming the guy. And then all of a sudden, everything on the farm was for sale.&#8221;</p><p>Daytona's racing and motorcycle history has created fertile ground for picking in the past. The show came to town for a July 2011 episode, stopping at Warren's Wholesale Liquors on Mary McLeod Bethune Boulevard, once the home of Pandora's Box Exotic Dancing. The pickers paid $1,500 for a neon &#8220;Pandora's Box&#8221; sign later valued at $2,000.</p><p>Wolfe came back to Daytona during Bike Week 2013 to unveil a new Indian Motorcycle engine. Fritz, also a motorcycle, dirt bike and motor scooter enthusiast, has a personal collection of about 90 bikes.</p><p>Fritz said the rare finds that make the cut on &#8220;American Pickers&#8221; aren't easy to find in reality. The &#8220;picks&#8221; are set up beforehand by the show's production company. A believer in karma, Fritz said he and Wolfe pay at least half of what they think an item is worth, even if the owner doesn't value it fully.</p><p>Fritz is also an admitted cheapskate, a pragmatist looking to turn a profit. He watches people pay $9 for a $1 beer at a baseball game, &#8220;but if I buy something for $300, and sell it for $550, then I'm stealing.&#8221; </p><p>In 2011, according to a news story in the Quad-City Times in his birthplace of Davenport, Iowa, Fritz was still driving the same 1986 Ford Ranger he'd owned for 24 years.</p><p>&#8220;You hear people say one man's junk is another man's treasure,&#8221; he joked Saturday. &#8220;I'd say no, 99 percent of the time, one man's junk is another man's junk.&#8221;</p>
