/Problem #2_1

int x = 5;
println("x is now: " + x);
if (x == 5) {
  x = 6;
}
if (x == 6) {
  x = 5;
}
println("x is now: " + x);

Output: "x is now: 5", "x is now: 5"

The problem with this code is that in the absence of an "else if" statement
x with revert back to "x is now: 5" instead of changing to and remaining "x is now: 6"

Problem #2_2

int x = 5;
println("x is now: " + x);
if (x == 5) {
  x = 6;
} else if (x == 6) {
  x = 5;
}
println("x is now: " + x);

Output: "x is now: 5", "x is now: 6"
