/**
 * <p>The toxi.util.datatypes package contains classes to work with ranges of
 * numbers instead of fixed values. These classes are very helpful for picking
 * randomized parameters throughout a larger application. There're also biased
 * versions of these range types which impose a bell curve distribution of the
 * randomly picked values, centred around the bias value. This demo interactively
 * visualizes the behaviour of such a biased range.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>move mouse horizontally to change bias value</li>
 * <li>move mouse vertically to adjust the standard deviation/strength of the bias</li>
 * </ul></p>
