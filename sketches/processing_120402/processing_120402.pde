<p><strong><a href="http://www.cheapuggbootsforsale.com">uggs outlet store</a></strong> What could be healther for kids than than bicycling to school in the morning? Not biking, according to officials at Risca Primary in Newport, United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cheapuggbootsforsale.com">uggs boots on sale</a></strong> Although the measures were not intended to be permanent they were put in place while 'risk assessments' were done.</p>

<p><p><b>Uggs</b></p>
<p>Pottstown Middle School in Pennsylvania recently banned outdoor boots in the classroom. The problem seemed to revolve around students smuggling in items in their boots that are prohibited in school - and they mostly were referring to cellphones and the popular Ugg boots.</p>

<p><p><b>Dodgeball</b></p>
<p>Students in a New Hampshire district had to find something else to do when the school board took dodgeball off the curriculum in March of this year.
<p>Despite the fact that the balls used are usually very soft, the intent was to remove so-called 'human target' games from the physical education curriculum.</p>

<p><p><b>Hugging</b></p>
Brampton, Ont.â€™s Earnscliffe Senior Public School enacted a 'no loving, no shoving' policy in an attempt to make the school safe.</p>
<p>But several students balked and turned to social media to protest the rule which they claim forbade them from even hugging.</p>

<p><p><b>Red ink</b><p>
Hundreds of schools back in 2008 in the United Kingdom banned their teachers from marking in red ink in case it upset the students.</p>
<p>The opposition to red ink seemed to be a world-wide trend with guidelines to schools in Queensland, Australia, also warning against red ink.</p>

<p><p><b>Best friends</b></p>
<p>Several schools in the United Kingdom banned 'best friends' and instead encouraged groupism .</p>
<p>Ostensibly this was done to help the children avoid the pain of breaking with, or getting over the loss of, a BFF.</p>

<p><p><b>Holding hands</b></p>
<p>In 2012 Tennessee senators approved an update to the state's sex-ed law to include warnings about holding hands.</p>
<p>Seems legislators saw the gesture as something akin to a 'gateway sexual activity.'</p>

<p><p><b>Yoga pants</b></p>
<p>Students at St. Joseph Catholic High School in Ottawa were told in 2011 that tight-fitting yoga pants did not meet the uniform code and banned students from wearing them.</p>
<p>The reasoning was that existing dress code rules already forbade them.</p>

<p><p><b>Silly Bandz</b></p>
<p>In 2010 a product that gained a huge following with youth were brightly coloured rubber wristbands called ' Silly Bandz .'</p>
<p>But several U.S. states including New York, Texas, Florida, and Massachusetts banned the bands branding them a hazard with all the kids fiddling with them.</p>

<p><p><b>'Boobies' bracelets</b></p>
<p>In 2011 a Kelowna middle school banned students from wearing breast cancer awareness wristbands because they claimed the brightly coloured bracelets were inappropriate. They were part of a breast cancer awareness campaign by Keep A Breast Canada and had 'I [love] boobies!' printed on them.</p>

<p>Children who don't follow the new rule may be sent to the office or won't get to play during recess.</p>
