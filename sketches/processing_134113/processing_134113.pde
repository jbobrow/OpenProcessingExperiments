// variables and println()

// variables can be thought of as labeled containers in which you can store data 
// variables have e certain typ: int integer numbers, float for floating point numbers (numbers with a decimal point)
// variables have a name, this can be anything
// variables have a value, which can change, hence the name variable ;)


// we declare a variable of a certain type, in this case an integer number
int a;

// and we assign it a value
a = 30;

// or we can do both steps at once
int b = 20;

// we can use the variables by name and it will return the value that it currently contains
point(a,b); 

// println() prints the value of a variable to the console
println(a);

// variables can be used to do calculations
int c = a+b;
println(c);

// or
println(a+b);
