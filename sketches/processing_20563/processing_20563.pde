/*
1.0 INTERFACE
    Create user friendly interface that readily displays the purpose
      and intent of the work. Clear so that users know what they will
      get out of the program and how to initiate the application.
    The interface is entirely available from the start with drop down
      menus &c. but greyed out if not applicable at the time, just
      so users can orient themselves properly.
    Provide initial background example of a work scanned using the 
      program so users know that the output will be radial and color
      based. 
    The goal is that with a glance, users can know if a book has long
      sentences, complex words, the diction, syntax, etc. so that
      they can compare works and genres, for example, the bible v. 
      the dictionary or poetry v. prose. 
    
2.0 USER INPUT
    Create a form system that allows users to submit works of fiction
      or writing, maybe if they had different input methods they can
      specify, such as block of copied text, .doc files, .pdfs, or web
      based book.
    The code will read the files for analyzation, "read" a pdf and
      extract text into a readable, scannable form.
    Maybe the program can automatically identify what file it is itself.
   
3.0 ANALYZATION PARAMETERS
    User sets these via another menu system, the summary of which will
      appear somewhere in the below screen in the form of "What does
      my book look like if..."
    Default is full color spectrum based on sentences/stanza/linebreak
     
    3.1 CONTENT SCAN
        Look up specific words, word length, word count, sentence
          length, frequently used words, frequently used letters, etc.
        Letters used, length of words, length of sentences, length
          of the piece will affect complexity. 
    3.2 OUTPUT AESTHETIC
        Saturation of color could be tied to any of the parameters
        Hue and depth and shape and orientation of the final output
          is based on user choices or a default choice, maybe random?
        Choice based on pallete picker?
    
4.0 UPLOAD
    The user clicks submit, the program accepts the file, but if the
      information isn't correct, it returns an error report
     
5.0 ANALYZATION
    Depending on the size of the speciment submitted, the program will
      enter its analyzation phase, based on analyzation parameters,
      quantifying words to convert to values and hues, height and width
      as applicable to create the circular/spiral patterns. 
     
6.0 DIGITAL OUTPUT
    You see the finished scan
    You can download it as a pdf or whatever file we think is usable
   
7.0 INTERACTION
    User explores the radial outputs and can zoom in and the interface
      will show what words or what letters provided that information
      or can see the sentences or via mouse hover.
    The output can have depth and can spiral around, too.

6.0 PHYSICAL OUTPUT
    Print as a poster :)
    The print page will have a template that will display the visual
      with a gridded information background, such as the Josef Muller
      Brockmann Beethoven poster.
    OR we can go with a 3D print and display ifnormation that way such
      as Jen Stark's paper sculptures
