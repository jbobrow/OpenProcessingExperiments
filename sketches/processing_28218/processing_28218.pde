/**
 * <p>This is a demonstration of the two available polygon clipping tools based
 * on the Sutherland-Hodgeman algorithm. As the name indicates, the ConvexPolygonClipper
 * class can clip a given polygon to the boundary of another (convex) polygon. Only the
 * boundary polygon needs to be convex for this to work. The SutherlandHodgemanClipper
 * is the original implementation of the algorithm and optimized for rectangular clipping
 * regions. You can toggle between both implementations dynamically.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>c: toggle between convex/rectangular clipping regions</li>
 * <li>b: toggle display of polygon boundaries/outlines</li>
 * <li>move mouse to move subject polygon</li>
 * </ul></p>
