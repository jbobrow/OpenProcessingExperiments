For some people one of the world's most desirable cars isn't special enough.</p>

Bentley factory
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lovebreitlingwatches.com">breitling</a></strong> Bentley's craftsmenship and attention to detail is what makes it a marque to be desired. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lovebreitlingwatches.com">fake breitling watches</a></strong> Lots of regular people just can't understand why anyone would happily shell out half a million dollars on a mere motor car when a Toyota Camry will do (roughly) the same job.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lovebreitlingwatches.com">breitling watches</a></strong> But Bentley tells us there is a solid percentage of folk among the seven billion inhabitants of this planet who will not settle for anything but the very best. So, a Breitling or a Rolex wristwatch ahead of a Citizen, Boss or Armani jeans rather than Levi's, never the Holiday Inn but always the Dorchester or Villa d'Est. And last year 8510 people chose to buy a Bentley, some for their own driving pleasure while others, chauffeur-driven, view the passing parade from plush rear seats.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lovebreitlingwatches.com">Breitling replica watches for sale</a></strong> Buoyed by anticipated demand for a new opulent high-performance SUV, Bentley predicts production by 2018 will sit comfortably between exclusivity and profit at around 15,000 sales. This is also the level that would still allow quality hand crafting within the factory.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lovebreitlingwatches.com">high quality breitling replica watches</a></strong> The excellence of materials, the craftsmanship and the design and engineering found in the Bentley range are what customers pay a premium for. Authenticity; too. If it looks like wood, then it is definitely wood.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.lovebreitlingwatches.com">Replica Breitling Watch- AAA Grade Breitling Replicas</a></strong> The average age of today's owners has slid down as the Bentley range makes a stronger connection with its sporty past. The company understands that in this ultra-competitive world, it is no longer possible for the grand old marques to rest on their buffed and burnished past, tallyho-ing about deeds that faded from our consciousness eons ago. Bentley appreciates that owners demand current technology sitting easily beside the traditional cues that define the brand - stunning performance encased in a visually powerful package dripping with quality and luxury.</p>
<p>A former engineering chief at Bentley Motors once explained that the brand is not in the rational car-building business. "We build cars for people who love cars, who like to feel good, who drive fast and appreciate things done well. Bentleys are emotional cars; they offer an experience."</p>
<p>Though synonymous with Britain and Britishness since its founding in 1919, Bentley has been wholly owned by Germany's Volkswagen Group for the past 14 years, while still manufacturing in Crewe in England.</p>
<p>Bentley headquarters, a squeaky clean refurbished wartime aircraft factory that once built Rolls-Royce Merlin engines for Spitfires and Lancasters, produces 49 or 50 cars a day (workers do a four-day week) - seven or eight flagship Mulsannes, and the remainder being Continental GT coupes and Flying Spur sedans. Bentley produces V8s and W12s in equal numbers. It is the largest maker of 12-cylinder engines in the car business.</p>
<p>A few minutes' walk from the car-making facilities and engineering department is the styling centre with 100 or so design staff. The designers and engineers can and do interact constantly, their cheek-to-jowl working environment helping resolve any nagging issues that threaten to slow the creative process.</p>
<p>The huge Mulsanne, all 2.7 tonnes of it, takes nearly nine weeks to build. The Continental GT and Flying Spur come together a little faster.</p>
<p>Customers may choose from 120 standard paint colours, 21 plush carpet selections, 14 wood veneers and 24 interior leather hides as well as a selection of rich ''heritage'' colours from previous Bentley models.</p>
<p>Bentley has experts in colour and trim on hand to personally advise customers on the myriad of choices, gently nudging them away from the outlandish. Dark exteriors are the popular choice but every so often something brighter catches the eye. A luminous blue here, a two-tone black over white with chrome radiator cowl and chrome wheels there.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its lack of automation. The 14 robots mainly handle the tough and dirty work unfit for humans.</p>
<p>In stark contrast with the wilful bunch under Derek "Red Robbo" Robinson back in the dismal 1970s, today's workforce is happy and proud. Many are employed to craft the leather, wood and carpets in the time-honoured way, by hand.</p>
<p>One primitive though effective touch is an old fork from the company canteen which master craftsmen and women use as a hole spacer before they hand-stitch the leather-bound steering wheels.</p>
<p>Bentley encourages customers to visit the factory to see their car being carefully built. They're not dissuaded from adding their own handiwork, a few stitches to the steering wheel perhaps.</p>
<p>Interiors are a Bentley speciality and every new leather and wood veneer option has been subjected to exhaustive durability tests including extremes of temperature. During the validation process, sun creams, skin lotions and even a chemical formula for human perspiration are applied to leather-hide samples to ensure no staining or fading.</p>
<p>The story goes that hides are hand-picked from herds contained in paddocks free of barbed wire, in cooler climates where the lack of insects means soft and supple, blemish-free leather finishes. An average of 17 cattle involuntarily donate their hides to every Mulsanne cabin.</p>
<p>Bentley's ''Wood Shop'', the largest of its kind in the luxury car industry, is another wonderland of cleverness. Chosen for their grain structure, veneers are from all around the world and stored in a special humidity-controlled chamber.</p>
<p>Laser cut to great accuracy and then applied onto a solid walnut base, the veneers are polished to a perfect lustrous finish. It's a process that takes 15 days, with fanatical standards of cleanliness for the lacquer spraying (by robot). In the modern world of making cars for the masses, this is highly unusual.There have been one-offs too, such as fashioning wood veneer from a customer's own tree. Wood is not the only hard-surface choice. Carbon-fibre, turned aluminium and piano black (clear lacquer over walnut) are popular.</p>
<p>For those who crave even greater personalisation, Bentley's Mulliner customising shop takes over, creating individual bespoke work to satisfy the whims of the wealthy and famous - and the eccentric.</p>
<p>Mulliner will do as little as add different stitching or a family crest to the headrests, or as much as extensive re-engineering, such as extending the wheelbase.</p>
<p>Some individualisation ideas can send the cost of a Bentley soaring above a million dollars.</p>
<p>Choices - colours, materials and extras - are endless. There are, for example, 22 different coloured seatbelts.</p>
<p>Fashion king Ralph Lauren asked for "black chrome" on his Bentley. Mulliner had to create the stuff since it didn't already exist.</p>
<p>Mulliner has, however, baulked at some bizarre requests.</p>
<p>"A customer did ask us to paint flames along the sides of his new car," Drive was told.</p>
<p>"It is not something we'd design ourselves so we said 'no'".</p>
