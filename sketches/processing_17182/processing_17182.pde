/**
 * <p>Demonstration and visualization of space deformation, showing both displacement
 * curve and result applied to a regular arrangement of lines. The lens logic is
 * encapsulated in a re-usable class of its own and additionally features
 * value smoothing and displacement strength. Using the strength value we can
 * specify a concave or convex lens type, either bundling or dilating the space
 * around the focal point.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Usage: Move mouse horizontally to change focal point, move vertically to adjust
 * lens behaviour between bundling/dilating.
