Create Interface
- create buttons and text fields, checkboxes, dropdowns for the interface

- visually appealing
Create searchable categories for each recipe:
- Find a few recipes to work with to test this out
- All recipes must have all these categories (or more) with info (easy to find, searchable)
    type of cuisine
    cook and preptime
    meat
    vegetables
    sauces
    starch
    (there may be a few more categories, depending on how complicated I can make it)

Create a way to idenfity each recipe as it's own entity
- each entity/recipe will be identified by its ingredients

Create a selection mechanism
- either a dropdown, or checkbox
- if mousePressed on checkbox, THEN highlight the box and select the requirement
- create also a random chooser [randomize(# items checked)]
    the "if i don't like it" option

Search spits out results
- if mousePressed on search box, THEN find text selections within recipe text document
- return the title of the recipe text document, letting the user know to choose this recipe*/                             

I will be using a few text-based recipes, and then if I can incorporate feeds into it, will try to make it happen.
