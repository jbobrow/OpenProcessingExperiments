//Hello World line code. Line coordinates are burrowed from a previous tutorial submitted by Professor Nick Senske.  
//The colors and thickness were the only variables altered. 

stroke(234,0,99);  //changes the colos of lines to red.
strokeWeight (3);  //increases line thickness.
line(0,0,100,100);
