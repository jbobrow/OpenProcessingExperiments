 Wales v South Africa: George North relishes Bryan Habana clash
WALES V SOUTH AFRICA
Venue: Millennium Stadium, Cardiff
Date: Saturday, 9 November
Kick-off: 17:30 GMT
Coverage: Live on BBC Two, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and online</p>
Wing George North says he is relishing facing in-form rival Bryan Habana when Wales face South Africa on Saturday.
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cheapernorthface.org">north face</a></strong>  A teenage North made a stunning Wales debut, scoring two tries in the
29-25 defeat to the Boks
in Cardiff in 2010.
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cheapernorthface.org">the north face outlet online</a></strong>  North faced Habana that day and is looking forward to facing the 2007 World Cup winner again.
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cheapernorthface.org">the north face outlet online sale</a></strong>  &quot;He is a man always on form, isn&#039;t he?&quot; said North, who became the youngest player to score for Wales on his debut, aged 18 years and 214 days.

George North
Wales wing
&quot;He is someone I grew up watching and I have been lucky enough to play against him a few times now.
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cheapernorthface.org">the north face outlet online</a></strong>  &quot;Hopefully, it will be another good challenge on Saturday.&quot;
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cheapernorthface.org">the north face outlet</a></strong>  North, who is still only 21, has emerged as a world-class talent since his first Test appearance for his country.
</p>
<p> The 45-time capped wing has won a Grand Slam in 2012 and a 2013 Six Nations title and played in a World Cup semi-final with Wales.
</p>
<p> He also played a key role in the British and Irish Lions&#039; Test series victory over Australia in 2013.
</p>
<p> North, who
left the Scarlets for Northampton Saints
in the summer, says he has fond memories of his debut with Wales despite the defeat.
</p>
<p> &quot;Obviously, it was a good day in personal terms, but again we were so close to winning that one. Hopefully, we can push on again,&quot; said North.
</p>
<p> &quot;I am a bit more experienced and a little older and a little wiser.
</p>
<p> &quot;I have learned my trade a bit more. I know what is coming and what is going on now.
</p>
<p> &quot;That was a new experience for me, but I am looking forward to the challenge because South Africa is a massive game for us.&quot;

Wales&#039; autumn 2013 Tests
<p> Saturday, 9 November:
Wales v South Africa
</p>
<p> Saturday, 16 November:
Wales v Argentina
</p>
<p> Friday, 22 November:
Wales v Tonga
</p>
<p> Saturday, 30 November:
Wales v Australia
</p>
Wales have only beaten South Africa once in the 26 meetings between the countries - the opening game at the Millennium Stadium in 1999.
</p>
<p> North is aware of the threat posed by the Boks after watching the final game in the 2013 Rugby Championship.
</p>
<p> New Zealand secured the title with a pulsating
38-27 win over South Africa
at Ellis Park in October.
</p>
<p> Habana scored two of the Springboks&#039; four tries in that defeat before he limped off with a hamstring injury midway through the second half.
</p>
<p> &quot;It was one of the best games I have ever seen, it was a mental game,&quot; said North.
</p>
<p> &quot;The quality and physicality they bring, it is going to be a tough challenge.
</p>
<p> &quot;All the boys are ready for that.&quot;
