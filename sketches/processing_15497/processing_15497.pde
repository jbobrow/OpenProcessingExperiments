/*
Welcome to Fish Storm!
In this retro 8-bit-looking game, you play as a hungry penguin.  
For some reason it's raining fish, so try to catch as many fish in your bowl as you can 
before time runs out and the storm ends.
CONTROLS: Use the left and right arrow keys to maneuver the penguin
Gray fish are worth 10 points
Orange fish are worth 15 points
Purple fish are worth 20 poins
But watch out, the more points they're worth, the faster they fall!
