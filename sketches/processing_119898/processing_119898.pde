<p><strong><a href="http://www.monclerjacketspro.com">moncler</a></strong> Jet-set darling Olivia Palermo known worldwide for her stellar sense of style — but to hear her tell it, this well-heeled young woman is just trying to wear what works best for her. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.monclerjacketspro.com">moncler womens jackets</a></strong> In an interview at a party celebrating Stuart Weitzman 's 5050 boot this week, Palermo told us about everything from how she gets ready every day to her favorite thing about Fall in New York City. Read on for more of our interview with Palermo. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.monclerjacketspro.com">moncler jackets for men</a></strong>  POPSUGAR: You are known around the world for having such impeccable style — how do you get up and approach what you're going to wear? </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.monclerjacketspro.com">outlet moncler</a></strong>  Olivia Palermo: I get up every morning and dress for my mood. I enjoy getting dressed, and everything has a bit of a polished element to it, but really I dress for myself and also what's appropriate for my schedule throughout the day. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.monclerjacketspro.com">moncler boots for men</a></strong>  PS: What are your favorite pieces to wear this season? Do you have pieces you look forward to, or do you look at what's new for the season? OP: It's a coincidence that we are at Stuart's event for the 5050 boot, because I've been a big fan of that style for many years, and I think it's a great, great boot to wear all the time. I have every colour, I basically wear them almost every day. Because you go to the office, sometimes you're in heels, and I think it's a chic, comfortable look to be in. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.monclerjacketspro.com">outlet moncler</a></strong>  PS: What's your favourite piece to rewear? OP: I always love a great blazer, a great fur vest, a great cashmere sweater. Zadig &amp; Voltaire has really great cashmere chunky sweaters in the Winter. Also skiing — I love my Moncler jacket, and skiwear I'm always inspired by. </p>
