//Basic Command - Cutting a zucchini

//The robot is standing in a straight up position where both arms are hanging straight down from body
//Set up in front of the robot is a cutting board, a zucchini and a knife on a table

println("move both arms into a 90 degree position");
println("extend left arm and grab zucchini");
println("use left arm to place zucchini in a position for cutting");

println("extend right arm and grab knife from the holding end into a cutting position");
println("use right hand to hover the cutting knife one inch above the right end of zucchini");
println("move right hand down to cut the right end of zucchini");
println("use fingers on left hand to rotate the zucchini 180 degrees");
println("use right hand to hover the cutting knife one inch above the uncut end of zucchini");
println("move right hand down to cut the uncut end of zucchini");
//now both ends of zucchini are cut

println("use left hand to rotate zucchini 90 degrees");
println("use right hand to over knife above zucchini");
println("use right hand holding knife to cut zucchini in half vertically");
//now its time to cut the zucchini into small pieces

println("use left hand to grab one of the halves of zucchini and hold into cutting position");
println("hover right hand with knife one inch to the left from end of zucchi one inch above the whole zucchini and cut");
println("repeat 15 times");

println("use left hand to grab last half of zucchini and hold into cutting position");
println("hover right hand with knife one inch to the left from end of zucchi one inch above the whole zucchini and cut");
println("repeat 15 times");

//now the zucchini is cut into small, individual peices

//P.S. I really like eating zucchini
