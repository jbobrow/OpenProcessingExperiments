VISUALIZING DATA IN THREE DIMENSIONAL TYPE

1. Collect data and import into processing.
2. Draw letterforms to mask the data. 
3. Write a program that uses libraries 
   (possibly using stimulus and the Gray-Scott 
   reaction diffusion and volumeutils) that 
   create interesting patterns in the type at 
   a 2D level.  
4. Write a program that uses the data to measure
   the density/volume of the type. 
5. Make a 3D space that is populated with slices
   of the 2D data stacked on top of one another.
6. Make type rotate and create ability to zoom
   in and out (still trying to figure out
   how to make it interactive...?).
7. Send to 3D printer to make type sculpture.
