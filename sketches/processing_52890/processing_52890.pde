/* I place 5 circles, one for the face, two for the eyes,
 and two for the mouth. For the mouth, I placed one circle, the same colour
 as the face, onto another circle that would be the mouth to make my smile
 a curve and not a simple circle. Im provoking the meotion of happiness, 
 due to the smile and his eyes wide open. I chose red and yellow because, to me,
 they seem like happy colours and my favorite colour is green.
