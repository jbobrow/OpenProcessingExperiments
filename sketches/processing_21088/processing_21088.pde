/*PSEUDO CODE
1. connect camera to computer
2. connect equalizer to pixels on the screen
3. have the equalizer react to the high bass/beats of any given song
 - when bass is high/strong, make the pixels explode higher/faster (though w/ no person, pixels barely move)
3. walk in front of the camera to change pixel colors of the background
 - when pixels on screen change color (someone walks into camera) pixels wrap around the body form
 - equalizers of the pixels now react off of the body
4. dance!
 - the more you have & if it corresponds with a high bass/beat, the BIGGER the explosion of pixels off the body!
