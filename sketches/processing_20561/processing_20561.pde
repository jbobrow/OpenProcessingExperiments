/*
1. Import content from a live Twitter feed - posts based on trending
     
2. Create a function that accepts user input - one word for each item of 
   clothing may be inputted.
      
3. Create a function that interprets the input; it will select phrases and 
   images from the imported feeds that include or are tagged with the 
   inputted word 

4. Create a compositional grid to act as a frame for the information - 
   this will act as an organizational tool for the information, specifying 
   where each phrase is placed and how much room it takes up
   
5. Create a function that arranges the phrases
   Place into predetermined grid 
   ( Type size of each line = number of words in the line?, or is determined 
     by how much room the phrases takes up )

6. Create a function that determines typeface
   ( This could be based on the information pulled? - it selects one 
     of 3 typefaces or typeface combinations)

7. Create a function that determines the color 
      Various ideas include:
      
      R = number of letters in first phrase
      G = number of letters in second phrase
      B = number of letters in third phrase
      if # of letters > 255, then use value 255
      
      R = number of R's in the phrases
      G = number of G's in the phrases
      B = number of B's in the phrases
      
      If colors are mentioned in the phrases, then use those colors.
      
8. Print pattern
      Take pattern to screen print onto t-shirts or sweatshirts or other 
      articles of clothing
