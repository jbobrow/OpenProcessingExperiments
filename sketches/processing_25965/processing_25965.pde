/*Exercise 1-1: Looking at how we wrote the instruction for line
“line(1,0,4,5);” how would you guess you would write an instruction to draw a 
rectangle? A circle? A triangle? Write out the instructions in English and then 
translate it into “code.”

rect(10, 10, 30, 20);

ellipse(70, 50, 20, 20);

triangle(30, 60, 10, 90, 50, 90);
