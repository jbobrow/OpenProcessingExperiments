/*My artist was Kazimir Malevich, a Russian painter, art 
theoretician and pioneer of geometric abstract art. 
In his art he utilized many different shapes in a 
collage with primary and complimentary colors. 
I thought I channeled many of his pieces well with 
the use of diagonal lines, jutting rectangular and 
box-like shapes and circles, taking from his Suprematist background.*/
