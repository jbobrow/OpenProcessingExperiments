/*Processing Pseudo Code:

What your Laugh Looks Like:

Concept: 
Create an application that can be set to run during a party to capture sincere human laughter. The application will use the built in microphone of a laptop computer to detect, record, and isolate the sonically unique laughs of individuals by creating a visualization of individuals laugh based on corresponding numerical values gathered from the frequency and pitch of the laugh. 

Process: 
-Setup a blank screen
-Access the camera/microphone on computer
-Setup up a running recording of sounds in the room
-Setup a dynamic background and point as meters for data collected from noises
-Identify spikes/fluctuations as “laughing”
-Using audio libraries numerically measure one or more of the following:
•   Sound Pressure Level
•   Sound Intensity Level
•   Sound Power Level 
•   Frequency Spectrum
•   Frequency response function
-Translate the numerical measurement taken from the recording and assign it a color and shape based on fluctuations
-Display data as changes in color and shape as your laugh visualized 
-Set a screen capture to take images whenever the background changes color
-Save screen capture images to a folder to have a record of your laugh visualized
