              FINAL PROJECT (Bringing It All Together)
                       DON'T DROP THE BALL!!
                          (By Isaac Groisman)
                          
 For the final project I made a game, basically it's about trying to hit a ball as
many times as you can with a paddle and not leaving it fall, if you hit it 50 times
you win the game, but there's a catch, each time you hit the ball, the paddle gets
smaller and smaller, so if you miss 50 times you lose the game and you'll have to restart.
When you get to the interface of the game you will see in the screen the instructions to start
playing by pressing the mouse, also you'll see the scores set to 0 in the upper left side, 
the game has its music audio made with soundation and made sure has no clips with audacity, 
it demonstrates use of sound concept, matching the theme of the work. when you start the game 
the sound starts playing, also you can mute the sound if you want by pressing 'M' and unmuted with 'U', 
you can pause the game any time you're playing with 'P', so the game and sound will stop, a message will be
displayed to unpause it with 'U'. And also you can take a screenshot of the game by pressing the 's' key.
After one of the scores get to 50, the game stops and pops a message to restart the game. 
I tried to specify with comments in lines of the code so you can understand what the code 
is trying to do. The background was made with photoshop, with a nice landscape image and two kids that 
are going to play ping pong, as you can see that demonstrates the visual concept, matching the 
theme of the work.

   So will you get more hits than misses?
