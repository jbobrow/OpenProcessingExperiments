01 DATA COLLECTION & ORGANIZATION
     Data is sorted by census-defined regions (i.e. Los Angeles, Riverside,
       Orange County CA region; San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, CA region;
       Seattle, Tacoma, Bremerton, WA region, 10 TOTAL) and census-defined 
       U.S. Cities (i.e. Honolulu, HI; Valejo, CA; Stockton,CA).
     Further divisions within data to include gender, age, as well as social 
       and economic conditions.
     
02 VISUALIZE DATA & USER INTERACTION
     Data is visualized on a map or abstraction of a map of the United States.
     When first opened, the entire U.S. map is shown, with the latest data sets,
       on population. Each region's population will be represented by a circle,
       whose size is relative to population of region. 
     You can further sort/organize/focus in on the data by selecting categories,
     (i.e. gender, age, income, education level, employment).
     User has the ability to zoom in and out of regions using a slider.
     User has the ability to slide between different years. (i.e. see growth
       in population/migration)

/* THIS IS THE FUTURA/LIGHT PAINTING

01 DRAW A WORD
    Using an exisiting typeface, draw a word inputted by a user.
    
02 RENDER THE INPUTTED WORD INTO A 3D MODEL

03 SCAN THE 3D MODEL TO CREATE "FRAMES" OF THE FORMS SLICED OUT OF THE 3D 
WORD MODEL, EXPORT THE FRAMES INTO A MOVIE, THAT CAN BE PLAYED ON AN IPAD

After playing the movie on the iPad in a physical world, while dragging the
iPad across a plane and taking long exposure photos of this process:

04 IMPORT PHOTOGRAPHS

05 ASSEMBLE PHOTOGRAPHS INTO A QUICKTIME MOVIE
