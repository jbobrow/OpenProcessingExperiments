// We'll build a simple dodgeball game.

// The game we are building is derived from:
// http://wwww.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=6640

// Before you can write a program, it helps to know what you want to do!

// A good starting point is to establish a rough outline for the game,
// which we can slowly fill in with actual code..
// This provides a very high-level description of the game, ie: what 
// we want to see happening. 

// This kind of outline is sometimes refered to as "pseudo-code", because
// it is written with programming in mind, yet only loosely describes the code

// VARIABLES
// most likely an int to keep the score
// a Player object (we'll need to write that Class)
// some enemy Ball objects (we'll need to write that Class to)
// maybe some PowerUp objects!?
// something to keep track of where the game is at 

// SETUP
// basic init (window size, etc)
// create the objects and the arrays
// set starting conditions

// DRAW
// depending on where the game is at:
// 1) show the intro screen
//    1.1) basically just some text on an orange background
// 2) run the game
//    2.1) draw all the objects (balls and player) 
//    2.2) move the objects
//    2.3) check if the player collides with a ball
//          if so, we're game over
//    2.4) show the score 
//    2.5) increase the score
// 3) show the game over screen 
//    3.1) draw the objects (but don't move them!)  
//    3.2) show the game over text 

// MOUSEPRESSED
// if we're on the intro screen or game over, start the game again
