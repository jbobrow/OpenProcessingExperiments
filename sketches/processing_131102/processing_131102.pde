//My composition is inspired by El Lissitzky, an avante garde russian artist that inspired the constructivist and the Bauhaus. Most of his early work was very minimilist, only containing a few shapes and a strict color pallet of red, tans and grays. I used all of these minimilist ideas to create my own composition following a lot of unseen rules he creates for himself. Most of his work is set on some sort of grid, having each shape line up in a way. He also believes that the most powerful shape is the triangle, as seen in multiple of El Lissitzkyâ€™s works, it is suppose to represent strength and prosperity.
