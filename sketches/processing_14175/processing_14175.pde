String Info1 = new String("If you think of the ocean, you probably think of fish, or possibly whales. But the vast majority of life in the ocean is invisible- tiny invertebrates called plankton make up quite a lot of it. And plankton need something to eat. Hence, their photosynthesizer counterparts, known as phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are extremely populous, and perform almost one-third of the world’s photosynthesizing. They’re the base of the ocean’s food chain. Billions of fish and other animals rely on them for food. In other words, they are extremely valuable.\n\nSo what would happen if they went away?");
String Info2 = new String("The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill is one of the largest in history. You’ve seen hundreds of pictures of poor, oiled animals on the news. But what is it doing closer to the base of the food chain? So far, little data has been retrieved, as acquiring it is difficult. However, the logic goes thus: Phytoplankton photosynthesize to make energy. What does photosynthesis require?  Nutrients, CO2, and sunlight. What does oil do to these resources? It absorbs nutrients and removes them from the water column, blocks sunlight and encourages bacteria which consume oxygen without creating CO2. In other words, oil is probably bad for our little green friends.");
String Info3 = new String("This simulation shows phytoplankton consuming nutrients and sunlight. The green circles are plankton, and how healthy they are is represented by their size. Click the “Add Oil” button to add oil, and see what happens.\nThe nutrients and sunlight levels are on an arbitrary scale.\nNew nutrient particles and phytoplankton are introduced every second.\nAll particles move according to a 2-D vector flow field, generated with 3-D perlin noise, which is adjusted every frame.");
