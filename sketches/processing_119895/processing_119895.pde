<p><strong><a href="http://www.timberlandbootstores.com">timberland boots kids</a></strong> Eva logger Bobby Collins spoke with uncertainty as he described the options he will be forced to pursue when the Courtland mill closes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.timberlandbootstores.com">timberland discount shoes</a></strong> In addition to the 1,096 International Paper employees who will be displaced when the mill closes by late March, the closure will also affect an estimated 5,404 loggers and foresters in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, according to the Alabama Forestry Commission.</p>
