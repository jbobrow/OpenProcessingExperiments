"Monogram Me"

This program will allow the user to create their own personalized monogram.
The pseudocode below lists many variables that could potentially affect the appearance of the type.
(These may be cut down, but I just wanted to include as many ideas as possible right now.)

Pseudocode:

Type single letter.
Choose typeface (from several options).
Make noise for different visual effects (talk, sing, play audio, etc).
Hold up color in front of camera to change color (what you are wearing, colored paper).
Move in front of camera for different effects (type stretches or things grow from it?).
Freeze composition when you arrive at desired effect.
Export as high quality pdf for print or export as video of process/experience.
