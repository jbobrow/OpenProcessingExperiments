// Example 15-9: Adjusting image brightness based on pixel location (Flashlight effect)

PImage img;

void setup() {
  size(200,200);
  img = loadImage( "me.jpeg" );
}

void draw() {

  // We must also call loadPixels() on the PImage since we are going to read its pixels.  img.loadPixels();

      // Calculate the 1D pixel location
      int loc = x + y*img.width;

      // based on proximity to the mouse
      float distance = dist(x,y,mouseX,mouseY);
      
      // The closer the pixel is to the mouse, the lower the value of "distance" 
      // We want closer pixels to be brighter, however, so we invert the value with the formula: adjustBrightness = (50-distance)/50 
      // Pixels with a distance of 50 (or greater) have a brightness of 0.0 (or negative which is equivalent to 0 here)
      // Pixels with a distance of 0 have a brightness of 1.0.
