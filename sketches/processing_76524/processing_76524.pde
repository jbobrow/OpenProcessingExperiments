println("the premise is, you have two arms with hands and two legs. You are free to use them.");
println("secondly, the existence of a sandwich is valid.");
println("now, assume you are in a room with a refridarator and some cutting tools");
println("then begin to use your legs to walk towards the refridgerator");
println("while standing in front of the refridgrator, raise your arms and use your hands to open the refirdgrator.");
println("assume there already are some materials available in the fridge. Use your hands to grab the bread, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, mayo sauce and the turkey slices");
println("Take all the materials out with both your hands.");
println("Put the materials on the table next to the fridge.");
println("Move over with your legs to the counter.");
println("Take the lettuce out of the package.");
println("Use one hand to lift the water handle in the sink");
println("Put lettuce underneath the running water") ;
println("Wash the lettuce with hands");
println("Put back the lettuce on the counter");
println("Repeat the action of three steps above for tomoto and cucumber.");
println("Use one hand to grab a knife");
println("Use the other hand to hold tomato");
println("Use the knife to pressure the tomato so that it become sliced into round thin pieces");
println("Repeat action infinite times till all tomatoes become sliced.");
println("Repeat action of three steps above for cucumber.");
println("Take out two slices of bread from the package.") ;
println("Lay one piece on the counter");

println("Put the turkey on top the veggies on the bread");
println("Grab mayo sauce bottle");
println("open the cap of the bottle");
println("turn the bottle over facing the bread.");
