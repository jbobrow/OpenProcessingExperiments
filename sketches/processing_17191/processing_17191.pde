/**
 * <p>This example demonstrates how to use the behavior handling
 * (new since toxiclibs-0020 release) and specifically the attraction
 * behavior to create forces around the current locations of particles
 * in order to attract (or deflect) other particles nearby.</p>
 *
 * <p>Behaviors can be added and removed dynamically on both a
 * global level (for the entire physics simulation) as well as for
 * individual particles only.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Usage: Click and drag mouse to attract particles</p>
