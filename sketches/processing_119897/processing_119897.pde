<p><strong><a href="http://www.uggbootsclearance2.us">ugg</a></strong>  Best Local Bookstore </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.uggbootsclearance2.us">uggs on sale cheap</a></strong> Caliban Books<br>
410 S. Craig St., Oakland<br>
412-681-9111 or www.calibanbooks.com </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.uggbootsclearance2.us">uggs clearance</a></strong> It's easy for a used bookstore, especially one that offers first-editions and other rarities, to get stuffy. But not a lot of dust gathers at Caliban, whose offbeat taste and wry humor are apparent in its window displays, and whose shelves offer up esoterics and ephemera alike. Caliban also offers contemporary zines and indie publishers and an expertly, if quirkily, curated music department. </p>

<p>Some MBA student out there should study how this Squirrel Hill institution thrives in an age of DSWs and global supply chains. But as City Paper readers already know, it has to do not just with wide selection &#8212; ranging from Cole Haan and Mephisto to Dansko and Uggs &#8212; but with the kind of knowledgeable, attentive staff you can't find in the strip mall.</p>

412-682-0788 or www.miniofpittsburgh.com </p>
<p>Quite a coup for a dealership specializing in just one make, and with just one location, to capture the checkered flag. But the sporty retro styling of models like the flagship Cooper &#8212; named after British racing legend John Cooper &#8212; still excites drivers. Mini of Pittsburgh caters to their taste with new and used vehicles, and a service department that draws raves.</p>

<p>What you eat matters &#8212; where it comes from, how it was grown, even how it's packaged. And the one-stop for health-conscious consumers is Whole Foods.

412-665-3640 or www.pittsburghzoo.org </p>
<p>No surprise that kids love seeing elephants grazing or sea lions gamboling, or looking up through a transparent tunnel at polar bears underwater. But even non-cuddly creatures fascinate here, as with the stingray exhibit, which allows kids to touch the rays themselves. Their enthusiasm may even help you get over lingering feelings of awkwardness in the monkey house.</p>
