/*1. Write comments in the text area explaining a piece of software you
would like to write.*/

/* For my project i would like to create a display that involves
a spcial user's experience. The experience will involve in selling 
the product brand as well as the identity. Through processing 
and arduino I would like to create a visual and physical model
of this product.

It would be more of a digital media piece involving electronic 
arts in mind to promote a certain product
Coding, wiring as well as physical modeling will be involved
to create a wonderful user experience
